1. Calculate the overflow times for three Timer/Counter modules that contain ATmega328P if CPU clock frequency is 16 MHz. Complete the following table for given prescaler values. Note that, Timer/Counter2 is able to set 7 prescaler values, including 32 and 128 and other timers have only 5 prescaler values.

| **Module** | **Number of bits** |**1** | **8** |**32** |**64** |**128** |**256** |**1024** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |
| Timer/Counter0 | 8 | 0,1,...,255 |  | | | | | |
| Timer/Counter1 | 8 | -128,..,127|  | | | | | |
| Timer/Counter2 | 16 | 0,1,...,65 535|  | | | | | |
